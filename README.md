### [20 Things Iâ€™ve Learned in my 20 Years as a Software Engineer](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/)

While it is always best to take advice derrived from personal experience with a grain of salt, it was interesting to read up on the pieces of advice that this software engineer deemed valuable after his years of experience in the field. The general ghist of the article and most of the advice pertain to the idea that you'll still be learning, still have questions, and still deal with unoptimized code no matter how much experience you'll have. Its reassuring to know that even seasoned veterans run into the same problems as a computer science student like myself.

Another piece of advice I found valuable was number 10, where the author states that:

>"We should be far more focused on avoiding 0.1x programmers than finding 10x programmers." 

I found this advice interesting not so much as for the advice itself, but because I didn't even realise that there exists this misguided value on the quantity of code a programmer produces in the industry. It was nice to learn this and that I should beware believing this misconception myself once I start working.
