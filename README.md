While it is always best to take advice derived from personal experience with a grain of salt, it was interesting to read up on what this software engineer deemed valuable after his years of experience in the field. The general gist of the article pertained to the idea that you'll still be learning, still have questions, and still deal with unoptimized code no matter how much experience you'll have. Its reassuring to know that even seasoned veterans still run into the same problems that a computer science student like myself does.

Another piece of advice I found valuable was number 10, where the author states that:

>"We should be far more focused on avoiding 0.1x programmers than finding 10x programmers." 

I found this advice interesting. Not so much as for the advice itself, but because I didn't even realize that there exists this misguided value on the quantity of code a programmer produces in the industry. It was nice to learn this and that I should be cautious of believing this misconception myself once I start working.
